0,1,NUST,NUST1,S: Sir thank you very much for calling in response to my email and making time for this interview. I would like to ask you how much time we have available for the interview.,Around 30 minutes.
1,2,NUST,NUST1,S: okay thank you. I hope the email was a helpful introduction to my project. I would like to start by asking your opinion on what do you see the overall role of universities? What should be their core activities and mission?,"Look I consider university as a knowledge factory because the role of universities is to create knowledge and faculty are the knowledge workers. So the output is the knowledge, input is the faculty and the student. Now the quality of knowledge/output will depend on the quality of your faculty as well as quality of your student. As far as quality of the student is concerned, I think we select best of the best. Every year approximately 60,000 students appear in our entrance examination and not everybody appears in entrance examination, only those who have secured 60% marks in FA/F.Sc. level or equivalence of O/A Levels (high school). The average should be 60% so 59.9% will not be able to appear. And we select approximately 2200-2300 people. So as far as input is concerned which is students, they are best of the best. Now, then comes the quality of faculty. Unfortunately, it is deteriorating over the years in Pakistan. So, the products which are available are not comparable with, for example, the top hundred universities in the U.S, UK, Canada. After 2000, the scale of universities widened in Pakistan and people are going all over as you have gone to Denmark. There are people who must have gone to Norway, must have gone to Australia. There are some that have gone to China, Thailand, and Malaysia, and Korea. But in our generation, our days, we only used to go North America and UK. In the late 90s the Australian avenue started opening. Until 2001/2002/2003 people started going to Australian Universities, particularly Australian national universities and others. But thereafter it became difficult for Pakistani students to entre United States. So the flow of going to that place slowed down considerably. Therefore, the Pakistani students were forced to look other avenues as well for higher education. So, everybody knows that the quality will be different. So, good quality of input as far as the students are concerned, relatively okay. We are very very particular believe me. Every year, like this year I think we interviewed over 200 people for faculty positions, and we accepted I think in economics faculty four candidates. And altogether in S3H (School of Social Sciences and Humanities) we selected about 10-11. So we are very particular about the quality and that is why we have maintained a good quality of faculty. We select and we take the best of the best students and that is what reflects in our global ranking. We are 415th in our global ranking. So we are in top 500 universities in the world. So we are producing a relatively good quality of students and our students that graduate from here they go to LSE (London School of Economics), Yale, Cambridge, Oxford. So, in that respect the university is imparting quality education and producing good quality of output and these people are entering in to the job market or going for further higher education. So we are at least imparting good quality workers so that they will be productive citizens. They will be contributing toward the economic development of the country in the next four-five decades. So I consider that this is the major role of the universities to produce good quality man power, send them in different places in the country or even abroad so that they can contribute effectively to the economic development of the country. So this is the main part. The other important thing as far as NUST is concerned, the other role I just wanted to tell you that, it not only creates quality manpower. And if you look at ASEAN (Association of SouthEast Asian Nations) or even Southeast Asian countries, the good quality of man power were one of the critical components for their faster economic development. So, this is what universities are doing. The other thing is that, it creates employment also. If you establish a university, thousands of manpower will be (produced). So it is a source of employment as well. And also it enhances the earning profile of its own faculty members. If you spend some time here in NUST, and you are getting X amount of salary, after five or six years you go to next university at a certain higher salary. So it enhances your own income and it helps you in your upward mobility. One unique feature of NUST is that if you look at those people who are entring in NUST, is that we are playing a role of inclusive development. Sixty to sixty five percent students appearing on merit, and the only merit criteria in NUST, they are coming from low-income group. And they are also coming from very far flung areas, Gilgit/Baltistan, Chitral. The females are coming from those places. So it is also empowering women. If you look at school of social sciences, where I am sitting here, sixty percent are female students and more than half of the faculty members are female. These facts are not known to the people outside. So, we at NUST are also contributing to removing or reducing the gender imbalances. Second, it is also contributing to SDGs goals in a sense that we are taking students of far-flung and relatively poor segment of society. And when they graduate when they go to the market, the world is for them. So you can see we have taken these students from far-flung areas and we do take care of these people. As you have seen just right now that one of our faculty, she is a student advisor and (she has told me that) some students are very irregular. And I am forcing them that I will meet them and inform their parents that why this student is not coming (to attend the classes). We don’t want these students who have entered on merit, none of them should go waste. You should go out and contribute to the economic development. So bulk of the students are coming from poor segments of society and from far flung areas and this is how we treat this as a inclusive development. Unlike there are universities and I am not going to name them, they belong to very elite, the elitest of the elite. We don’t have that kind of a culture here. Bulk of the students are relatively from far flung/backward areas and relatively poor. We give scholarship to roughly 300-400 million (PKR) per annum to these people because they are poor and cannot afford. If they complete and they go out, they will become productive citizens. Their generation will change. I have seen from my own eyes madam. I woman came to me weeping and was wearing a sandal and shalwar kameez (the ordinary dress), she was from a village. And her son got admission here on merit. She had to pay 70,000 rupees for admission. She said she does not have any money, she went to see rector. He said you just go and leave the boy here. The University paid his admission fee and we looked after them for four years. When he was graduating his sister also enrolled here. You can imagine that education of those two students must have changed the life of that woman. This is inclusive growth. The bread baker's kids are studying here but they have come on merit. Just imagine, some taxi drivers' kids that are very poor and when they get education from NUST their generation will change. There will be a big change in the whole family. This is what we think that we are contributing. The university should be contributing like this."
2,3,NUST,NUST1,S: So you are saying that education at NUST is the core mission.,"Of course. Contributing to the society. We also see that we have made social work a compulsory. No student will graduate from NUST, until and unless they have spent one semester, two credit hours course on social work. We call community services. They have to do two credit hours of community services. You must have seen downstairs that some students were selling something, they are generating funds. After that they will use this money to distribute some necessities among poor people. Now it is winter and students set up stalls on different places and collect money to buy warm clothes. They go to the poor areas and distribute those clothes. We give them community welfare concept. And they should also be contributing toward the society and not only in economy. And every university should be doing this not only NUST. These should be the prime duties of every university."
3,4,NUST,NUST1,S: So the community service is going on through teaching as well. How do you think it is working through research?,"Exactly. Regarding research there are many many problems that we are facing today in Pakistan. For example, myself, I am the member of prime minister's economic advisory council so through that I have a direct access to the prime minister and whatever we can do sitting here for the policymaking through our research or the type of work we are assigned we do that. We are helping other ministries also in terms of CPEC (that) how we can use CPEC in an effective manner for the economic development of the country. So we are providing those services also both through our research writing and our participation on those areas. So yes the research is ‘the’ main area through which we can be contributing to the policy making of the government. We can contribute through our research in enhancing knowledge, improvement in the literature. There are students in our engineering school who have done some innovations also. I am told that there are 300 patents have been filed already and 100 patents have been approved. This is the contribution and this is again coming from their research. So this is what every university should be doing and this is what we are doing."
4,5,NUST,NUST1,S: How do you see that there are other channels as well apart from education and research. Are there other ways through which the university can or is helping the society at large through knowledge platforms or through some other services?,"If you look at around the world, universities and their think tanks paly a very important role in policymaking either domestic, or inter-regional, or international levels. This is exactly what we do. Next month I will be going to China. I have been invited by international finance forum. This is like G20. We call it F20, comparable to G20. So at that level where the former prime ministers of many countries are participating. You know if I am invited there, the thing that I can contribute to their proceedings. I have been asked to present paper also on the new globalization and its challenges and impact. So we are contributing through our research and lectures. Not only the domestic policy making but regional as well as international and this is not a new thing that we are doing. Every good university around the world, they have a think tank through which they contribute to the national policy, regional policy and international policy."
5,6,NUST,NUST1,"S: How do you measure your performance that this is your contribution to the society, to the labor market or for example, also to low income students to improving gender equality?","See we are very closely linked with our alumnis. And when we see our output in good place, they are doing very well, this is our contribution. One way to measure is in which places our students are going. We are also contributing to the civil service of Pakistan. Every year, 10-15 students from NUST are appearing in civil service exams and passing that. Last year five students from this school (S3H) passed and now they are going through the training process. One of them is in foreign service, two of them in audits and account. One of them information services, and one student from Punjab Civil Service. So we are also contributing to civil bureaucracy in Pakistan through contribution to the policy making. At international level there are many of our faculty members travelling abroad most of the time. At every moment in time at least one faculty member is abroad. If they are invited, it means they are of that worth that people are inviting them. This is how we think that the university should be doing."
6,7,NUST,NUST1,S: Are there any reports as well that you could share with me. Some evaluation or some reports that you have prepared on your activities and looking back and seeing this is what we have done.,"There are many things we are doing. When this government came we prepared a report on CPEC, the document is some where lying there, I don’t know where but it is somewhere here. Then the recent event which is taking place in Pakistan after this government came, should Pakistan go to the IMF, should not go to the IMF. Yes we are directly contributing to that (for advising) the Prime Minister. And why I am using ‘I’ because in that meeting everybody said, yes sir we should go to the IMF. I was the only person who said no we should not go to the IMF. And now Prime Minister who was very vocal at that time that everybody is saying then we should go. Now saying that no, we may not go to the IMF. So I changed the mind of the PM. This is I think my greatest contribution."
7,8,NUST,NUST1,"S: Ok. What are the problems that are there for the universities, especially to make the impact that you want to make?","The quality of faculty. NUST, I consider it as an island. NUST is not a true reflection of all other universities in Pakistan. Our universities are producing unemployable graduates. Why, because lack of quality of faculty. The quality of faculty is low because they don't pay them more. So it all comes form the money. If you have money you can buy the best faculty. If you have lesser money than you have to make it work with whatever you find, the students have to be taught anyway. Then we will produce same level of graduates. The major challenge is that it is extremely difficult to find good quality faculty in Pakistan, extremely difficult. And sometimes it is very frustrating also."
8,9,NUST,NUST1,S: And what do you mean by the quality?,"Means that PhDs are not coming from the top universities of the world. Our generations are gone. We have gone to the top twenty universities of the world. I am a graduate of UPenn and Johns Hopkins University. I don’t see anybody going to Johns Hopkins. There are faculty sitting here my colleague, they have gone to Colombia University. They are students of a Nobel Laureate, I myself was a student of noble laureate. But how many are now going to University of Pennsylvania, John Hopkins, Colombia, Chicago, Harvard, MIT, none. So our generation will fade away in the next four five years. Then those who will remain it is race to the bottom. I call this race to the bottom. We are gradually adjusting downward ourselves. How can we expect to produce good quality of students? This is my worry and this is a challenge. We have spread very thinly ourselves. We established universities in all local corners of the country. We should not have done this. We should not have opened universities in every nook and corner of the country. Harvard is only one place. People from the whole world go there, Harvard is not going to the streets of the world. We have spread it so much by opening universities in streets and towns there is no quality and faculty there. We are producing PhDs there who have no idea what is happening in the world. How will they further transfer knowledge."
9,10,NUST,NUST1,S: Given our context we have a problem of access as well. Aren’t we still at the basics?,"It’s been seventy years, what do we mean by basics."
